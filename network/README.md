### Project
This tutorial walks you through how to make an [IRC bot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat_bot) with [Twisted](http://twistedmatrix.com).  You will be introduced to testing, logging, an overview of how the internet works, as well as event-driven programming, different internet protocols, and making a portable application.

The project’s code is based off of [Jessamyn Smith](https://twitter.com/jessamynsmith)’s IRC bot – the [talkbackbot](https://github.com/jessamynsmith/talkbackbot), where if anyone says “That’s what she said” in an IRC channel, the bot replies with a notable quote from a woman (that’s what she really said!).
