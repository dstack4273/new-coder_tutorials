You're a new coder. You're interested in learning how to code, not just syntax. You're sick of monkey-see, monkey-do types of tutorials.

Let's set your teeth into some real coding.  Your hand will be held in the beginning, but as you progress you'll see yourself approaching the projects more comfortably. 

Start off with [How to Work through these Tutorials]({{ get_url('begin/')}}) and then dive into the [tutorials]({{ get_url('tutorials/')}}). Take your time; these are at your own pace. 

If you need help, or you want to show off, don't hesitate to [contact me]({{ get_url('contact/')}}) about anything.
