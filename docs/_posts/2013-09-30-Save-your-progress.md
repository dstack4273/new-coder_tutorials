This is an introduction on saving your code the way a developer does – through source control management. [git](http://git-scm.com/downloads) is what is used for these tutorials.

### What is git?

git is software. You use git to help manage your source code. While you still “Save” your code files the traditional way through your text editor, it is good practice (and used by professional engineers and hobbyists alike) to “save” your code with a source code management tool.

Instead of “Save” and “Save As”, you “commit” your code to your local repository. A repository (a.k.a. repo) can be thought of the main, root directory for a project or a package.

Get in the habit of committing your code regularly, whether when you‘re done for the day, when you‘ve finished coding out one of the parts of the tutorial, before you answer the phone when someone calls you, etc. 

***Do not confuse git and GitHub!***  git is software, [GitHub](http://github.com) is a company that offers remote hosting for your git repositories (rather than just having a local copy on your machine). [BitBucket](http://bitbucket.org) is also a company that offers remote hosting for your git repositories (as well as Mercurial repositories). Simply put, they offer a social aspect to coding – allowing you to connect to other developers.

To setup git locally on your machine, GitHub has a few great resources:

* [First time setup git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git)
* [Create a repo with git](https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo)
* [Fork a repo with GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo)

### Benefit to using GitHub or BitBucket

When you have code up on GitHub and/or BitBucket, not only do they implicitly provide back up to your code in case anything happens to your local machine, but it also is a resume for you as a developer. 

As you work through these tutorials, I encourage you to use GitHub or BitBucket (or any other service that allows you to publicly share repositories) to “push” your code to so others can see your progress. While I suggest you to locally commit often and commit happily, only push code to GitHub/BitBucket when there is a good completion point (e.g. when you've finished a tutorial).
