Scrapers that are used in real life, and where to go from here.


### In action

* [Google](http://www.google.com) itself scrapes the web for its search catalog.
* [Heather Arther](http://twitter.com/harthvader) gave a lightning talk for [Women Who Code](http://meetup.com/women-who-code-sf) on [how she hacked the London Olympics with a web scraper](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vRPse4bssb4)


### Where to go from here

##### Challenge yourself
* Looking for a job? How about a house or an apartment? Create your own scraper for openings.
* Try some visualization with plotting queried your database – how does today’s deal for photography look compared to last week’s?

##### Additional Python libraries
* [Beautiful Soup](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/BeautifulSoup/)
* [lxml](http://lxml.de/)

##### Books, readings, and websites
