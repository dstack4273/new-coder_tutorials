## About the Project

Learning something new is difficult; it takes guts. Folks come in with a lot of energy and eagerness, only to experience discouragement when there aren't a lot of resources to step beyond the 'learn syntax' to programming. Often there are questions of, "Well, I worked through this beginner book. Now what?" How do you answer that?

Many want to learn to code, and many choose Python as a first language. You direct them to Learn Python the Hard Way, Codecademy, or Dive into Python. Great! But now what?

I've built 5 digestible projects to gradually progress the Python learner from near drowning to a decent swimmer. The goal is to have new coders feeling accomplished and to continuing learning.

## About Me

I am an insomniac software engineer for Red Hat. I am also the founder of the [San Francisco Chapter][1] of [PyLadies][2], a mentorship group for women in the Python and Open Source community.
            
I have a business degree in finance and economics, but fell in love with programming in 2011. I work on [freeIPA][7], particularly on integrating the product into other Open Source projects.

I like to speak. A [lot][8]. I particularly talk on the Python community, as well as the work that I do with freeIPA integration. [Email][4] me if you would like to make my talks list longer.

I respond to [twitter][3] faster than [email][4].

I [vent][5] sometimes. My personal projects can be found on [GitHub][6].
