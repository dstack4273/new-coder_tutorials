## Web Scraper

### Project
Scrape data from a regularly updated website (e.g. cafeteria's weekly lunch menu, local bank interest rates, Groupon/LivingSocial/etc deals), save to a database (postgres), hook up to a cron job, and use the Data Visualization tutorial to play with different visualization techniques.
