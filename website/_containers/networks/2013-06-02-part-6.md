Running the bot application and its tests.

### Running tests + the bot with Twisted plugins

#### Running tests
Let’s first test to see if our tests pass.  Twisted has a plugin command, `trial`, that will easily pick up the tests that we wrote.  Within our `new-coder/network` directory, with our virtualenv activated, we’ll run our tests:

```bash
(NetworkProj)$ pwd
/Users/lynnroot/Dev/new-coder/network
(NetworkProj)$ trial tests
```

You should see something like the following:

```bash
(NetworkProj)$ trial tests
tests.test_quote_picker
  TestQuotePicker
    test_pick ...                                    [OK]
tests.test_talkbackbot
  TestTalkBackBot
    test_privmsgAttribution ...                      [OK]
    test_privmsgNoTrigger ...                        [OK]
    test_privmsgPrivateMessage ...                   [OK]
    test_privmsgWithTrigger ...                      [OK]

```

#### Running our bot

Time to play with our bot!  First, copy `settings.ini.EXAMPLE` to `settings.ini` and edit the file as necessary:

```
[irc]
endpoint = ssl:host=irc.freenode.net:port=7000
nickName = shereallysaid
realName = bot: provides quotations from notable women

channel = #newcoder

[talkback]
quotesFilename = quotes.txt
# Trigger phrases, in lowercase
triggers =
    that's what she said
```

Then run the following command with our virtualenv activated:

```bash
(NetworkProj)$ twistd -n twsrs
```

and you should see the following:

```bash
(NetworkProj)$ twistd -n twsrs
2013-06-27 16:27:51+0200 [-] Log opened.
2013-06-27 16:27:51+0200 [-] twistd 13.0.0 (/Users/lynnroot/.virtualenvs/NetworkProj/bin/python 2.7.2) starting up.
2013-06-27 16:27:51+0200 [-] reactor class: twisted.internet.selectreactor.SelectReactor.
2013-06-27 16:27:51+0200 [-] Starting factory <talkback.bot.TalkBackBotFactory instance at 0x107e2bc68>

2013-06-27 16:28:07+0200 [TalkBackBot (TLSMemoryBIOProtocol),client] [shereallysaid has joined #newcoder]
```

Now if you log onto irc.freenode.net as yourself and join the #newcoder channel, you should see `shereallysaid` in the channel.  Try sending `that's what she said` in the channel:

<img class="displayed" src="{{ get_asset('/images/irc_trigger.png')}}" />

Now try sending `shereallysaid: ping` in the #newcoder channel:

<img class="displayed" src="{{ get_asset('/images/irc_ping.png')}}" />

And last, try sending a message to the bot directly: `/msg shereallysaid hello`:

<img class="displayed" src="{{ get_asset('/images/irc_msg.png')}}" />

Looking back at our terminal, we can see the output of our logs:

```bash
(NetworkProj)$ twistd -n twsrs
2013-06-27 16:27:51+0200 [-] Log opened.
2013-06-27 16:27:51+0200 [-] twistd 13.0.0 (/Users/lynnroot/.virtualenvs/IRCbot/bin/python 2.7.2) starting up.

```

When you’re done, within the terminal, press `CTRL+C` to terminate the bot.  When doing so, you’ll see the following:

```bash
2013-06-27 16:41:16+0200 [-] Received SIGINT, shutting down.
2013-06-27 16:41:16+0200 [TalkBackBot (TLSMemoryBIOProtocol),client] connectionLost <twisted.python.failure.Failure <class 'twisted.internet.error.ConnectionLost'>>

```


### Running tests + the bot with a Makefile

If you have `Make` installed (test in your terminal via `make --version`), you can create a Makefile, like so:

```make
run:
	twistd -n twsrs

cov:
	coverage run --branch --source talkback  `which trial` tests
	coverage report
	coverage html

.PHONY: run cov
```

A Makefile simplifies commands for us – notice that these are just commands we could run in our terminal directly..  If we want to run the bot, all we’d have to do is `make run` to start our bot.  If we want to run our tests, all we’d have to do is `make cov`.

Running our tests via `make cov` makes use of `coverage` (a requirement that is listed in `requirements.txt` and should be in your virtualenv already).  When we run `make cov`, we see this:

```bash
(NetworkProj)$ make cov
coverage run --branch --source talkback  `which trial` tests
tests.test_quote_picker
  TestQuotePicker
    test_pick ...                                                          [OK]
tests.test_talkbackbot
  TestTalkBackBot
    test_privmsgAttribution ...                                            [OK]
    test_privmsgNoTrigger ...                                              [OK]
    test_privmsgPrivateMessage ...                                         [OK]
    test_privmsgWithTrigger ...                                            [OK]

coverage html
```

It runs our tests, but then also runs `coverage`, which assesses the amount of code that is covered by our tests. After its run, `coverage` creates a nice html page within `htmlcov` that you can view in your browser.  Just open up the `index.html` file in `new-coder/networks/htmlcov/` and it will launch in your browser:

<img class="displayed" src="{{ get_asset('/images/coverage_report.png')}}" />

You can click on line items to see more detail:

<img class="displayed" src="{{ get_asset('/images/coverage_bot.png')}}" />

You’ll notice that we don’t have 100% coverage.  This is because there’s no need to test log messages.  Having a goal of 100% coverage can be unrealistic, and is not typical in the industry.  To read more about what reasonable test coverage is, StackOverflow has a [great answer](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/90002/what-is-a-reasonable-code-coverage-for-unit-tests-and-why) to such a question.

**If you do not have `make` installed**: you can still run coverage, just run the commands that are detailed in the Makefile:

```python
(NetworkProj)$ coverage run --branch --source talkback  `which trial` tests
(NetworkProj)$ coverage report
(NetworkProj)$ coverage html
```
