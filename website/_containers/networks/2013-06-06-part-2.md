Walkthrough of the pseudo-random quotation picker.

Module Location: [new-coder/network/talkback/quote_picker.py](https://github.com/econchick/new-coder/blob/master/network/talkback/quote_picker.py)

### Module Setup

We want to select from our list of quotes at random, so we use the `random` library from Python’s standard library and import the choice function:

```python
from random import choice
```

This module does not generate or select quotes at “true” randomness.  The [`random`](http://docs.python.org/2/library/random.html) module in Python generates pseudo-random number based off of the [Mersenne twister](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mersenne_twister).  The `choice` method uses `random()` to generate a pseudo-random number between 0 and 1, multiply it by the number of items in the list to choose from, and index into the list.

### QuotePicker class

Next, we need to define the behavior of how we want to grab a quote that our bot uses.  We’ll create a class, `class QuotePicker(object):` with two functions, `__init__` and `pick`:


```python
# <--snip-->

class QuotePicker(object):

    def __init__(self, quotes_filename):
        """Initialize our QuotePicker class"""
        # <--snip-->

    def pick(self):
    	"""Return a random quote."""
    	# <--snip-->
```

We want to initialize our class with the file that we plan to pull a quote from.  If you remember from earlier tutorials, Python has a few keywords and built-in functions for file input/output.  We open our quote file using the `with` keyword, which will implicitly take care of closing our quote file when we are done with the `with` loop:

```python
# <--snip-->

def __init__(self, quotes_filename):
    """Initialize our QuotePicker class"""
    with open(quotes_filename) as quotes_file:
        # <--snip-->

# <--snip-->
```

Within the `with` keyword, we label the opened file, `open(quotes_filename)` as `quotes_file`.  We then read each line item in the `quotes_file` (each quote is on its own line) with another built-in function, `readlines`, and assign it to `self.quotes`.  This variable, `self.quotes`, will be accessible to the rest of the `QuotationPicker` class, including our next function, `pick`.

```python
# <--snip-->

def __init__(self, quotes_filename):
    """Initialize our QuotePicker class"""
    with open(quotes_filename) as quotes_file:
        self.quotes = quotes_file.readlines()

# <--snip-->
```

For our `pick` function, we use the `choice` function we imported from `random` to randomly pick a quote from `self.quotes` variable we initialized in `__init__`.  To be safe, we use a built-in string method, `strip`, to clean up any extraneous blank spaces and whitespace characters that may be before or after the quote itself.

Rather than creating a variable and assigning it `choice(self.quotes).strip()` and then returning the variable, we simplify it by just returning `choice(self.quotes).strip()`.

```python
# <--snip-->

def pick(self):
    """Return a random quote."""
    return choice(self.quotes).strip()

# <--snip-->
```

The whole `quote_picker.py` module put together:

```python
from random import choice


class QuotePicker(object):

    def __init__(self, quotes_filename):
        """Initialize our QuotePicker class"""
        with open(quotes_filename) as quotes_file:
            self.quotes = quotes_file.readlines()

    def pick(self):
        """Return a random quote."""
        return choice(self.quotes).strip()
```


That was pretty simple, right?  I hope!  Now let’s move on!
