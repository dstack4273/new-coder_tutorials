Implement the GUI of the Sudoku game with which a user will interact.

## Creating the Sudoku Board UI

The GUI (graphical user interface) is the interface with which your user will interact.  We’ll be using `Tkinter` (tee-kay-inter), a GUI framework in Python’s standard library, to build the simple interface.

Here is what we will be working towards:

<img class="displayed" src="{{ get_asset('images/gui/gui_example.png') }}" width="500px" />


There are a few libraries we’ll need from the `Tkinter` module:

```
from Tkinter import Tk, Canvas, Frame, Button, BOTH, TOP, BOTTOM
```

We’re going to create a class to represent the Sudoku UI that will inherit from `Frame`, which we’ve imported from `Tkinter`:

```python
class SudokuUI(Frame):
    """
    The Tkinter UI, responsible for drawing the board and accepting user input.
    """
```

`Frame` is defined as a “rectangular region on the screen”<sup>[1](http://effbot.org/tkinterbook/frame.htm)</sup>.  This is essentially just a widget of our game.

We will create an initialization function, which will take two parameters, `parent`, and `game`:

```python
class SudokuUI(Frame):
    """
    The Tkinter UI, responsible for drawing the board and accepting user input.
    """
    def __init__(self, parent, game):
        self.game = game
        self.parent = parent
        Frame.__init__(self, parent)

        self.row, self.col = 0, 0

        self.__initUI()
```

So for each new Sudoku game, we will create a new UI, `SudokuUI` with a `game` (which we will be passing in our `SudokuGame` later), as well as a `parent`.

Here is great explanation from the tkinter [mailing list](https://mail.python.org/pipermail/tutor/2010-June/076550.html) about what a `parent` attribute is for a tkinter frame:

> All widgets belong to a parent or master widget until you get to some kind of root or main window that is the master odf [sic] all its sub widgets.

> When you delete a window you delete the master and it deletes
all its children. The children delete their children, and so on until
all the widgets making up the window are deleted. [...]
Similarly if you add a widget to a window you must tell the new
widget where within the containment tree it sits, you tell it who
its master is. Usually the widget will register itself with its master.

We’ll see later when we put together the whole script that the `parent` is actually the main window.

Moving on, we’ve set `self.row` and `self.col` each to `0`.  We’re just initalizing the row and columns to use later.

Wrapping up the `__init__` function, we call `self.__initUI()`, which we will now implement.

### initUI

This private method of the `SudokuUI` class is the logic that sets up the actual user interface.

```python
class SudokuUI(Frame):
    # <-- snip -->

    def __initUI(self):
        self.parent.title("Sudoku")
        self.pack(fill=BOTH, expand=1)
        self.canvas = Canvas(self,
                             width=WIDTH,
                             height=HEIGHT)
        self.canvas.pack(fill=BOTH, side=TOP)
        clear_button = Button(self,
                              text="Clear answers",
                              command=self.__clear_answers)
        clear_button.pack(fill=BOTH, side=BOTTOM)

        self.__draw_grid()
        self.__draw_puzzle()

        self.canvas.bind("<Button-1>", self.__cell_clicked)
        self.canvas.bind("<Key>", self.__key_pressed)
```

We first set the parent title (which is our main/only window) to `"Sudoku"`.  Simple enough.

Next, `self.pack` is a `Frame` attribute that organizes the frame’s geometry relative to the parent.  We’re wanting to fill the entire frame, where `fill=BOTH` means to fill both horizontally and vertically any extra space that is not used by the parent.  Other options include `NONE`, `X`, or `Y`.

Next is the `canvas` attribute.  `canvas` is a general-purpose widget that we will use to display our board.  We will use the earlier-defined global variables from part 1, `WIDTH` and `HEIGHT`, to help setup the actual width and height of the puzzle canvas.

Then within the `canvas` attribute, we again set `pack`, where the entire square of the puzzle will fill the space, and will be pulled to the top part of the window.

Below the canvas for the puzzle is the button to clear answers.  We create the `button` attribute using `Button`, giving it the text of the button, and the command for the button to call when it is pressed.  Here, we set the command to `__clear_answers`, which we will define later.

Like `canvas`, we will set `pack` for the button to fill the space, and sit at the bottom of the window.

Next, we call two helper methods, `__draw_grid` and `__draw_puzzle`.  I’ll go over that in a second.

Finishing up the `__initUI` method, we have two calls for `bind` on our `canvas` object.

The first `self.canvas.bind` is binding `"<Button-1>"` to a [callback](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callback_%28computer_programming%29#Python) – another method - `__cell_clicked`.  With tkinter, `"<Button-1>"` is actually a mouse click, and refers to the default left button on a mouse (for right-handed mouse settings).  `"<Button-2>"` would refer to the middle button of a mouse, and `"<Button-3>"` would be a right-click.  This is _not_ to be confused with the `clear_button` we defined earlier.

So here, when the user clicks on the puzzle with a single left-click of the mouse, our UI will call `__cell_clicked` function, which we will define in a bit.  The `bind` method will actually pass in the `x` and `y` location of the cursor, which in `__cell_clicked` we will turn into actual cells of the puzzle.

Similarly, on the next line, we bind `"<Key>"` to the callback function, `__key_pressed`.  This binds the key that a user pressed (e.g. the guessed number) to the `__key_pressed` method.

### Helper Functions

In `initUI`, we call two methods, `__draw_grid` and `__draw_puzzle`.  We also bind functions to user events: clicking on a button to clear answers, clicking on a particular cell, and pressing a key to fill in a cell.

#### Draw Grid method

The `__draw_grid` private method literally draws a grid to represent the Sudoku layout:

```python
class SudokuUI(Frame):
    # <-- snip -->

    def __draw_grid(self):
        """
        Draws grid divided with blue lines into 3x3 squares
        """
        for i in xrange(10):
            color = "blue" if i % 3 == 0 else "gray"

            x0 = MARGIN + i * SIDE
            y0 = MARGIN
            x1 = MARGIN + i * SIDE
            y1 = HEIGHT - MARGIN
            self.canvas.create_line(x0, y0, x1, y1, fill=color)

            x0 = MARGIN
            y0 = MARGIN + i * SIDE
            x1 = WIDTH - MARGIN
            y1 = MARGIN + i * SIDE
            self.canvas.create_line(x0, y0, x1, y1, fill=color)
```

Here we are iterating over a simple range between 1 and 9 (excludes 10).  If the current iteration number (`i`) is divisable by 3 with no remainers (hence, the modulo, `i % 3 == 0`), then the color of the line should be blue.  Otherwise, set it to gray.

The first chunk draws the vertical lines by calling `create_line` on our canvas object.  The second chuck then draws the horizontal lines.  Simple enough!

#### Draw Puzzle method

The `__draw_puzzle` private method then draws the puzzle by filling in the cells with the pre-filled numbers defined in whatever `.sudoku` board we pass in.

We first call `delete` on the canvas to clear out any previous numbers.  This is helpful for when the user wants to clear out the puzzle and start over.

We then iterate over rows and columns, and create a cell.  We then grab the same X & Y location of the cell from the game’s puzzle.  If it isn’t zero, then fill it in with the appropriate number, otherwise just leave it blank.

You’ll notice that the color of the number could be either `"black"` or `"sea green"`.  So if the initial puzzle has certain numbers already filled in, it will be set to black.  Otherwise, when a user inputs a number, it will be set to sea green.  If you’d like to use different colors, check out [this list of Tkinter-supported color names](http://wiki.tcl.tk/37701).

Note that `__draw_puzzle` will end up being called every time a user inputs his or her answer into a particular cell with the updated `game.puzzle` container the user’s guesses/answers.


#### Clear Answers

Earlier, we created a button for the user to clear his or her answers, and set the command of the button to the method `__clear_answers`:

```python
class SudokuUI(Frame):
    # <-- snip -->

    def __clear_answers(self):
        self.game.start()
        self.canvas.delete("victory")
        self.__draw_puzzle()
```

With `__clear_answers`, we first call the `start()` method associated with the game (from `SudokuGame` class).  This resets the puzzle to its original state.  We also delete the `"victory"` status if the user previously solved the problem (which we will implement later).  Lastly, we re-draw the puzzle with the original puzzle.
